👋 Hi there! I'm Jason Murphy, a passionate Full-Stack Developer who recently graduated from App Academy's intensive 6-month coding bootcamp.

🚀 Skilled in JavaScript, Python, Flask, Node.js, Express, React.js, and PostgreSQL, I've honed my abilities to craft responsive and dynamic web applications from scratch.

🌱 Always eager to learn, I thrive in challenging environments and am constantly seeking out the latest technologies and best practices to integrate into my projects.

🎬 **Hobbies**: When I'm not coding, you'll find me immersed in films, strumming my guitar, or diving into immersive games.

🌐 Looking for remote work opportunities where I can bring my skills to the table and collaborate with a forward-thinking team.

📫 Feel free to reach out to me for any collaboration, project, or job opportunities. Let's build something amazing together!
